# Substance

[Substance](http://substance.io) is a free and open source distributed document management system designed for collaboration and making sense of digital information in a new way.

## Modules

Substance has very modular architecture. Lower level modules such as our rich text editing programs are designed to be used in it's own right. Because everyone needs a text editor.

### Surface
Surface is intended to be an extensible low-level interface for rich text editing. It doesn't introduce any UI components, but an API for managing user-defined text annotations. For an implementation of a ritch text editor and several examples please check the Substance Sandbox.


### Library

The Substance Library is different from traditional libraries, in that there are no books stored but digital documents that are always up-to-date. Everyone with permission can read and write documents at any time. Open 24/7.
