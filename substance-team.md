# The Substance Core Team

## Michael Aufreiter

Michael is committed to the idea of open digital publishing by considering content as data and seperating it from presentation. Back in 2012 he kicked off Substance in order to verify that idea. Oh noes. Test.

Focus:

- [Overall Architecture](http://interior.substance.io/features/distributed.html)
- [Substance Composer](http://substance.github.com/modules/composer.html) - The document editor
- [Substance Talk](http://substance.github.com/modules/talk.html) - A JSON-based data exchange prototcol

Projects:

- [ASK KEN](http://askken.heroku.com/) - A Visual Knowledge Browser
- [Prose](http://prose.io/) - A Content Editor for GitHub
- [Dejavis](http://dejavis.org) - Visual Analytics for the Browser

## Oliver Buchtala

Oliver was involved in the design process of both, the original Substance Document Format and [Data.js](http://github.com/michael/data) Substance's graph-oriented data-layer. He's a strong background in Mathematics, and dynamic code generation. And he recently supervised a Google Summer of Code project bringing [Javascript to SWIG](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/swig/about.html). Based on his experience we'd be able to combine web-technology (Javascript / CSS) and native components to build out a Substance Application that can either run locally or in a hosted environment. Oliver received his Master’s of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Passau in 2005. After that, he has been working for three years in a research project in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Passau ([Organic Computing](http://www.organic-computing.org/)). The last three years he has been working as a computer scientist and mathematician for [FLLL](http://www.flll.jku.at) where he was involved in several industrial projects.

Focus:

- Native Substance Backend
- Packaging Substance as a native application
- [Substance Library](http://substance.github.com/modules/library.html)


Projects:

## Victor Saiz

Victor joined the team this spring. He's been working on the most challenging part, namely web-based content editing. We're moving away from our previous approach using contenteditable (a browser-native interface) to our our very own implementation (Substance Surface) that allows us to build components like Substance Text and the Substance Composer, offering arbitrary complex annotations.
Victor has a degree in Sound engineering but started working in the web sector in the early 2000's. He has worked primarily in the private sector working for clients such as Myspace, the Spanish Chamber of Commerce, Fila Europe or Ericsson Sweden.


Focus:

- [Substance Surface](http://substance.github.com/modules/surface.html)
- [Substance Text](http://substance.github.com/modules/text.html)


Projects:

- [Helly Hansen Norway](http://hellyhansen.com/) - Full rewrite incl. web shop with product faceted navigation (v.2010/2011).
- [FryTuner](http://mortensen.co/projects/fry-player/) - Server based music player for retail stores and restaurants.
- Ericsson Brand Analytics visualizer – Interactive presentation tool that visualizes the company's figures in comparison to its major competitors – per country/region – on a yearly basis from live data.
