## Introduction ![koala](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/606131/koala.png "inline-dummy")

Working with digital documents used to be hard because they usually come in various presentation-centric formats, optimized for print or display on a specific device.

If content were considered as data, we could make it accessible to computers and allows new ways of processing them. We could not only view digital documents, we could query them, just like a database.

Along with the release of Lens, weâ€™d like to promote a data-centric representation of scientific content, optimized for being consumed by web-clients. 

### The Lens Document Format

Lens can display any document that conforms to a simple JSON representation. It's pretty easy to work with once you get the gist of it.

Let's start with an empty document, and add some content to illustrate how all this works.

```js
{
  "id": "introducing_lens",
  "nodes": {},
  "properties": {},
  "views": {
    "content": [],
    "figures": [],
    "publications": []
  }
}
```

First off all content is stored in content nodes, a flat unordered data-structure where each node is identified by a unique id. Every node is assigned a type and has a number of properties.

### Properties

You can define custom properties on your document and store them within the `properties` object. Let's set a title for our new document.

```js
   ...,
   "properties": {"title": "Lens"},
   ...
```

### Content Nodes

Let's start by adding some text to our document by specifying a text node. It's just a simple piece of JSON.

```js
{
  "type": "text",
  "id": "text:intro",
  "content": "Lens is an alternative way to view a research article (Figure 1).",
}
```

As mentioned before every content element needs to have a unique identifier, as well as a type which describes what kind of content is stored. This tells Lens how to render that piece of information.

In order to structure our document better we also have support for headings. They look like so:

```js
{
  "type": "heading",
  "id": "heading:intro",
  "level": 1,
  "content": "Introduction",
}
```

That was easy. We've defined two content nodes, which go into the nodes object, using their id as a key. One last thing to do is updating the views object to reflect the order of our newly added content elements.

At this point, our document would will like so:

```js
{
  "id": "hello_world",
  "nodes": {
    "text:intro": {...}
    "heading:intro": {...}
  },
  "views": {
    "content": ["heading:intro", "text:intro"],
    "figures": [],
    "publications": []
  }
}
```

### Annotations

Text nodes only store plaintext, which is by design. In order to cleanly separate presentation from the content, we keep all annotations in separate objects. However, annotations are just regular nodes. Let's add an emphasis annotation for "Lens". 

```js
{
  "id": "annotation:1",
  "type": "emphasis",
  "source": "text:abstract",
  "pos": [0, 12]
}
```

Like with any node, we assign a unique id and a type. Annoation nodes also take a source and pos property, stating which text node is referenced (`text:abstract`) and which characters the annotation belongs to (`[0, 12]` 0 being the startpos and 12 being the character offset). 

There are some more basic annotation type including `strong`, `link`, `inline-formula` etc. Over the next weeks we'll add a complete documentation covering all node types.

### Figures

However, now let's add a figure now and link it with some text.

```js
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "image:fig1",
  "label": "Figure 1.",
  "url": "http://Lens.elifesciences.org/Lens.png",
  "large_url": "http://Lens.elifesciences.org/Lens_large.png",
  "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00336.003",
  "caption": "caption:53"
}
```

As you have noticed, figures also link to a captions node, which adds some labels and description to figures.

```js
    "caption:53": {
      "type": "caption",
      "id": "caption:53",
      "title": "Lens",
      "content": "",
      "source": "image:fig1"
    }
```

In order to have your newly added figure show up in Lens's Figures tab, you have to create an entry in the figures view.

```js
"views": {
  "figures": ["image:fig1"]
}
```

```js
 "annotation:2": {
      "type": "figure_reference",
      "id": "annotation:2",
      "source": "text:intro",
      "target": "image:fig1",
      "key": "content",
      "content": "Figure 1A,B",
      "pos": [32, 8]
    },
```

### Publications

It works the same way for publications, that you want to reference in your research article. A publication node looks like so:

```js
{
      "type": "publication",
      "id": "publication:bib38",
      "authors": [
        {
          "given-names": "S",
          "last-name": "Piccirillo"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "title": "The Rim101p/PacC pathway and alkaline pH regulate pattern formation in yeast colonies",
      "year": "2010",
      "source": "Genetics",
      "volume": "184",
      "fpage": "707",
      "lpage": "16"
    }
```

Like with figures, they have to be added to `publications` view to be shown in Lens. And you can link them with the text by specifying a publication_reference annotation.

```js
    "annotation:23": {
      "type": "publication_reference",
      "id": "annotation:23",
      "source": "text:22",
      "target": "publication:bib34",
      "key": "content",
      "content": "Murray, 2003",
      "pos": [
        85,
        12
      ]
    },
```
