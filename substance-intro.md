eLife Lens is a novel system for writing on the web. Instead of tying the content to a presentation specific format, Lens uses the Substance Document Model in order to make the links that exist within a document easy to navigate.

## Thanks

We'd like to thank anybody who supported the project from the beginning. We've received code contributions from people all over the world. Among them (in chronological order) Samo Korosec, Tim Baumann, They all helped to shape the idea

Our most recent work was backed by a Shuttleworth Flash Grant that we received earlier this year. We'd also like to thank anyone who supported our Pledgie campaign. We didn't reach our funding goal
