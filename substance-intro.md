# Substance

[ This document is a work in progress ]

**Substance** is a completely free and open technology stack motivated by the idea of taking a pure data-driven approach to working with digital documents. From content creation to publishing we believe that there should be better tools that address the problem from a fresh angle. After the first release of our web-based Substance.io platform, with most of the functionality in place, we took a step back and decided to give the whole thing a new spin. And that's how the new Substance platform came to be.

Substance is build around the following core ideas:

## Operations

Every change to a document is tracked as an operation that can be applied an reverted to an existing document state.

## Semantic editing

Unlike traditional word-processors, Substance focusses on content, by leaving the layout part to the system not the user. Because of the abscence of formatting utilities, it suggests structured, content-oriented writing.

## Content is data

Substance considers content as data, which allows digital documents to be queried like a database. With little effort, you can take the Substance data format and display it the way you want.


## There's no one size fits it all solution

We created a 

## Extensible

Weâ€™ll be adding a plugin system for the Composer in order to make it easy for developers to create their own content types and share them with the Substance development community.

## Open Source

Open Source

Behind the scenes the Substance is mainly composed by a stack of open source modules that will be publicly released under the Open Source MIT license.

## Substance in the wild

Substance is pretty young. However, it can already be found in the wild. In collaboration with UC Berkeley graduate student Ivan Grubisic and eLife, we created an interactive document viewer for scientific content, [eLife Lens](http://lens.elifesciences.org). It is designed around a custom implementation of the Substance document format, the [Lens Article](http://github.com/elifesciences/lens-article).

eLife Lens is a novel system for writing on the web. Instead of tying the content to a presentation specific format, Lens uses the Substance Document Model in order to make the links that exist within a document easy to navigate.

## Future

We'll be relaunching Substance.io with a reference implementation of a minimalistic collaborative editor, based on our new set of well-tested components. We're quite close, however we'll take enough time, so the next time we launch a new version Substance.io

## Work with us

Do you see Substance work for your use-case? Contact us at info@substance.io. We're happy to discuss options how Substance can be integrated with your application use-cases.

## Thanks

We'd like to thank anybody who supported the project from the beginning. We've received code contributions from people all over the world. Among them (in chronological order) Samo Korosec, Tim Baumann, Victor Saiz. They all helped to shape the idea and the code.

Our most recent work was backed by a Shuttleworth Flash Grant that we received earlier this year. We'd also like to thank anyone who supported our Pledgie campaign. The bad news is we didn't reach our funding goal. The good news is we got the proposed release ready anyway. We were working hard on the past 6 months and reimplemented Substance from scratch. A solid foundation is now ready, paving the way for exciting use-cases and applications.
